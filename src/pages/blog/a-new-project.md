Over my professional career, I've written my fair number of documents and posts
going over technical decisions and executions, but none recently (and certainly
not publically), despite being an engineer of many opinions. Given some free
time and motivation, I've gathered the enthusiam to attempt to do some of that 
writing again, as well as using this blog as a testing bed for some cool pieces
of tech I've been itching to work with (Astro and Svelte, namely).

This post is mainly a placeholder so I can publish this site without writing
anything substancial.
